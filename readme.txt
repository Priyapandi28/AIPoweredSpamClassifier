Creation of Chatbot in Python

â€¢ Build a command-line chatbot with ChatterBot.
â€¢ Train the chatbot to customize its responses.
â€¢ Retrain the chatbot with industry-specific data

Step 1: We need to install chatterbot module, So open Windows Power shell and run the
        following commands :
    â€¢	python -m venv venv
    â€¢	venv\Scripts\activate
    â€¢	python -m pip install chatterbot==1.0.4 pytz

Step 2: Next write the following code and save it as 'bot.py' and Run the following
        command,When you run bot.py, ChatterBot might download some data and language
        models associated with the NLTK project.Itâ€™ll print some information about that
        to your console.Python wonâ€™t download this data again during subsequent runs.
     
CODE:
from chatterbot import ChatBot
from chatterbot.trainers import ListTrainer
chatbot = ChatBot("Chatpot")
exit_conditions = (":q", "quit", "exit") 
while True: 
    query = input("> ")
    if query in exit_conditions:
        break
    else:
        print(f"ðŸª´ {chatbot.get_response(query)}")
        
Step 3: Youâ€™ll train your chatbot using ListTrainer to make it a little smarter
        from the start.Youâ€™ll also learn about built-in trainers that come with ChatterBot,
        including their limitations.

CODE:
from chatterbot import ChatBot
from chatterbot.trainers import ListTrainer
chatbot = ChatBot("Chatpot")
trainer = ListTrainer(chatbot) 
trainer.train(["Hi", "Welcome, friend     "])
trainer.train(["Are you a plant?", "No, I'm the pot below the plant!"])
exit_conditions = (":q", "quit", "exit") 
while True: 
    query = input("> ")
    if query in exit_conditions:
        break
    else:
        print(f"ðŸª´ {chatbot.get_response(query)}")

Step 4: Repeat the 3rd Step with different Conversations. Then the chatbot will be trained
        well and successfully created using python programming language.

You can also train your Chatbot with Datasets by importing the dataset file, For example   
lets import a dataset 'chat.txt' which is an text file, the chatbot is trained by the      
dataset by using ListTrainer       

CODE:                                                                                  
#bot.py                                                                                                                                                                  
from chatterbot import ChatBot                                                        
from chatterbot.trainers import ListTrainer                                          
from cleaner import clean_corpus    
CORPUS_FILE = "chat.txt"
chatbot = ChatBot("Chatpot")
trainer = ListTrainer(chatbot) 
cleaned_corpus = clean_corpus(CORPUS_FILE)
trainer.train(cleaned_corpus)
exit_conditions = (":q", "quit", "exit") 
while True: 
    query = input("> ")
    if query in exit_conditions:
        break
    else:
        print(f"ðŸª´ {chatbot.get_response(query)}")
